# Collision Detection

This example can be used to create animations around the pointer. 
The area where the pointer should be placed for some specific function will be marked by these colorful circles that react to pointer by avoiding it.

I have changed some values(size of canvas, size of circles, colors) and played around with the collision settings trying to figure out something for our project where we point out to users where the token shold be placed on the screen and that is why I will try to make it into prototype
