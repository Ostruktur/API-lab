# Collision Detection

This example can be used to create animations around the pointer. 
The area where the pointer should be placed for some specific function will be marked by these colorful circles that react to pointer by avoiding it.


I have decided to take this example and make it into prototype because that is what I felt our project prototype needed. We needed to indicate to places where the token should be placed, and to show how token is interactive with the moodboard. By placing the token on the screen, circles form around the token showing the interactivity with the response to placing the token. I made the area smaller and added some text that indicates that it is the moodboard. The idea is to have this area of circles placed on different parts of the screen, where every area reacts different (eg. showing different information).
Update: we actually decided to use this thing in our project and showed it to some classmates.(created some touch responsive tokens and used it on tablets)
