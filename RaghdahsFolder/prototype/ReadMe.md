# D3

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. We choose this library to help us visualize the data that is collected by Tokens from a plant and displayed to the user by colorful animations, charts, etc.

## Installation

Use link directly:

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>

## Usage

 in this example, I used 3 circles to display different pieces of information about a plant.
 the first circle demonstrates the water level by the blue color
 the second circle demonstrates the soil vitamins by the color brown
 the third circle demonstrates sunlight level by the color yellow

 the users can simply visualize the data about a plant by placing the token on the interactive screen and they will be updated about the status of their plant.
