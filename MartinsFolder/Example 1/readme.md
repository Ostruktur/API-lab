In example 1 i'm using "Zoomable Circle Packing" (https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing), to experiment with a more fluid user interface, using D# and "ZCP" as a base.
The reason for this is the ability to use your own database to feed data back into the API, which would suit us well and help us fake the UI even better.
And i really like the look and feel of the zoom-ins, jumping between data-points in a "futuristic" way.
It could lend a very nice feel to the fluiditiy of our concept if it works out and hopefully it will help with displaying our affordances to our users in a clear and concise way.
