In example 1 i'm using "Zoomable Circle Packing" (https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing), to experiment with a more fluid user interface, using D# and "ZCP" as a base.
The reason for this is the ability to use your own database to feed data back into the API, which would suit us well and help us fake the UI even better.
And i really like the look and feel of the zoom-ins, jumping between data-points in a "futuristic" way.
It could lend a very nice feel to the fluiditiy of our concept if it works out and hopefully it will help with displaying our affordances to our users in a clear and concise way.

Found a good example to work with ("https://codepen.io/splarty/pen/oLPEmy") using data from football-players to feed into the D3-visualization, this seems like a good ground for me to use my own .csv file with data.

Managed to post ex.1 using a new template to work from, will probable push this as prototype v.

Seems promising and i should be able to substitute the .csv with a plantbased or write my own .csv to reach the goal
will start playing around with the layout and style aswell.

I have managed to load a local Monstera.csv file and im getting some small results, it can read the "Family" - value from the file, but nothing much else at the moment.
