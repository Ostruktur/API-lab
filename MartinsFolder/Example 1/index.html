<h1> Assists Per Year - La Liga</h1>
<h2> A Zoomable Circle Packing Visualization</h2>
<div id='container'>
<div id='text1'>This visualization employs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing#Unequal_circles">Circle Packing of Circles of Unequal Sizes</a>. Where the sizes of the circles are determined by the size of the contents. In this case, the contents are the number of assists per year by the top players in La Liga.
<br>  <br>  
For example, from the visualization, we can see that 2015 was the year with the most assists and 2010 was the year with the fewest. The yellow circles signify players and the size of the circles signifies the number of assists that each player had in that year.
