# API-lab

A repo for Group 8 prototyping in the API-lab

A general README.md
Explaining the project:
In this project we will test out different API's and conduct experiments with the help of said APIs, trying to develop them into prototypes suitable for our plant-project.

What the project does
D3.js

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS

Describe your project
We wanted to explore different ways of visualizing the necessary data in our concept, plathealt, caring over time,the plants time-line and a multitude of other data-streams.

Example 1
Donut Chart – https://observablehq.com/@d3/donut-chart
For this example, I’m going to make a basic donut chart(such as the one we made for our prototype video). Maybe add a progressive-animation?

Example 2
Smoothing Zooming – https://observablehq.com/@d3/smooth-zooming 
In my second example I’m using a chart called “Smoothing Zooming. It’s a chart that implement smooth pan-and-zoom transitions between two views.

Simple chart used to check levels
Example 2

Example 1
liquid fill gauge

Sound of nature when information is displayed. E.g. Humidity: Waves, Sun: Wind, Fertilizer: Birds singing, water dripping when the plant needs more water

Example 2
Bar Stacker Gauge

Why the project is useful
D3 works with web standards like HTML, CSS and SVG, there is no new learning or debugging tool required to work on D3


What is the project is exploring (remember you are prototyping)
We wanted to explore different ways of visualizing the necessary data in our concept, plathealt, caring over time,the plants time-line and a multitude of other data-streams.
