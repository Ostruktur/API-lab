# Collision Detection - Playaround area for Moodboard by Group 8

This example can be used to create animations around the pointer. 
The area where the pointer should be placed for some specific function will be marked by these colorful circles that react to pointer by avoiding it.


I have decided to take this example and make it into prototype because that is what I felt our project prototype needed. We needed to indicate to places where the token should be placed, and to show how token is interactive with the moodboard. Therefore, we created playaround area in our app to learn users that that area, which will be placed on different parts of the screen, is interactive with the token. By placing the token on the screen, colors react to token by moving with it and avoiding it showing how token can interact with our app. I made the area bigger because we decided to give a whole tab to this learning experience for users and added some design and text to indicate that token will be interactivve with these areas. The idea is to have this colorful areas of circles placed on different parts of the screen, where every area starts different action (eg. showing different information in pop up windows  (which is what i wanted to do but I chose the example that is to complex for me at the moment)).

I also added some buttons which have certain actions. The pictures that are listed are the pictures of the plants that the user owns. I styled some things in the CSS file as well

Update: we actually decided to use this thing in our project and showed it to some classmates.(created some touch responsive tokens and used it on tablets)
