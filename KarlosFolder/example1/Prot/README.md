# Collision Detection

This example can be used to create animations around the token while it is moving around the moodboard. 
The area where the token should be placed for some specific function will be marked by these colorful circles that react to token by avoiding it, showing that token is in the right place. Area that shows where the token can be places can be placed on different part of the screen(wherever it is needed to show that the token can do something).
