In example 2 i will try to play around with D# and "Radial Tidy Tree" with i see a potential to use in displaying the timeline/lifeline of a plant, as we have as one part of our core concept.
This layout and API-part, seem to be suited to this idea, as it seem like i can load it with data from an array and database of my own choice.

This could work well with the concept as a whole, seeing different events in the plantslife being tagged and cataloged in the array, this could be done both automatically and by the user.
