# D3

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. We choose this library to help us visualize the data that is collected by Tokens from a plant and displayed to the user by colorful animations, charts, etc.

## Installation

Use link directly:

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>

## Usage

 in this example, I used 3 circles to display different pieces of information about a plant.
 the first circle demonstrates the water level by the coloe blue.
 the second circle demonstrates the soil vitamins by the color brown.
 the third circle demonstrates sunlight level by the color yellow.

 each circle contains a value that can be changed by clicking inside the circle.
