# API lab library

For this assignment we used D3.js. It is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. We choose this library to help us visualize the data that is collected by Tokens from a plant and displayed to the user by colorful animations, charts, etc.

## Installation

Use link directly:

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>

## Usage

 In this example, I used a battery shape animation to visualize data about plant's energy.

 This value can be updated by clicking inside the battery animation.
