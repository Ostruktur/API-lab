In example 2 i'm using the "Smooth Zooming" example from https://observablehq.com/@d3/smooth-zooming. I've chosen this example to experiment how a fluid user interface could look like in our prototype.
D3.js gives me the ability to use my own database to feed data back into the API, which suits us well and helps us "fake" the UI even better.
If I succed with creating what I have in mind, this "Smooth Zooming" example could lend a very nice feel to the fluiditiy of our concept. Hopefully I'll create something that will help with displaying our affordances to our users in a clear and concise way.
