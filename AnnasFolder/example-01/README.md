In example 1 i'm using the "Donut" example from https://observablehq.com/@d3/donut-chart, to experiment with creating a fluid user interface.
D3 gives me the ability to use my own database to feed data back into the API, which suits us well and helps us "fake" the UI even better.
I also really like the look and feel of the donut, it's minimalistic and suitable to show percentages!
If it works out, this example could lend a very nice feel to the fluiditiy of our concept. Hopefully I'll create something that will help with displaying our affordances to our users in a clear and concise way.
