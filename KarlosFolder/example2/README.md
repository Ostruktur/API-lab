# Sequences Sunburst
This example can be used to show the data of the specific plant. It is supposed to whow the best way for a plant to feel absolutely perfect. Middle is the starting point(where we would put the token, it can be connected with the other example where the midddle would be filled with colorful circles) and if we point to the first level (from the middle), it will show what are the chances of plant feeling not 100% perfect by adding supstance X. In the second circle we can see that by adding two supstances (or more of the same one), the chance of plant feeling not absolutely perfect are lower because we have more detailed view. Same principle apllies by going further.  
At the last circle there is a lot of options. The part of the fun is that the user has to find the best absolute combination for his/her plant. The right order of adding things will be displayed above the circle thing by showing steps. 
Amount of substances added can be determined for all of the different plants. For example, if the step by step says : soil-soil-soil-water. The user adds 100g of soil three times and 100ml of water one time.
