In example 2 i will try to play around with D# and "Radial Tidy Tree" with i see a potential to use in displaying the timeline/lifeline of a plant, as we have as one part of our core concept.
This layout and API-part, seem to be suited to this idea, as it seem like i can load it with data from an array and database of my own choice.

This could work well with the concept as a whole, seeing different events in the plantslife being tagged and cataloged in the array, this could be done both automatically and by the user.
And being able to section of different events or data-points in the liftime of a plant, by tags or other markers seems promising to use in the concept

Seems like a great beginning, has some if not all the basic parts needed to start experimenting.
