Hopefully this will detail a successfull prototype or atleast the process in trying  to make something useful for our project.

As we have at the core of our concept, a visual interface, we have been looking at the usefulness of these APIs / datasets / librarys in furthering that cause.

I will try to use one of the to examples to try to make it into oen pice of our UI for the plant project, looking at making the feeling of the inferface into a fun and fluid interface, avoiding textblocks and infodumps, rather going in a form-over-function way, to really work with the interface as a main pillar of the concept, trying to invite the user into using and exploring the space.

Decided to go ahead with ex.2 as it shows most promise and its the most fun at the moment to work with.
