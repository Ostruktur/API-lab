In example 1 i'm using "Zoomable Circle Packing" (https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing), to experiment with a more fluid user interface, using D# and "ZCP" as a base.
The reason for this is the ability to use your own database to feed data back into the API, which would suit us well and help us fake the UI even better.
