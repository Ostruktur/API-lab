# Sequences Sunburst
 Sequences Sunburst

This example shows how it is possible to use a [sunburst visualization](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sunburst)  with data that describes sequences of events. Hover over the segments to see the corresponding sequences.

A good use case is to summarize navigation paths through a web site or app, as in the sample data file (which is attached to the \`csv\` cell). Where a funnel lets us understand a single pre-selected path, this allows us to see all possible paths. For example, we might want to compare visits that start directly on a product page (e.g. after landing there from a search engine) to visits where users arrive on the site's home page and navigate from there.

I have given different names to each category so that they make sense when they combine into a percentage.
This example can be used to show the data of the specific plant. It is supposed to whow the best way for a plant to feel absolutely perfect. Middle is the starting point(where we would put the token, it can be connected with the other example where the midddle would be filled with colorful circles) and if we point to the first level (from the middle), it will show what are the chances of plant feeling not 100% perfect by adding supstance X. In the second circle we can see that by adding two supstances (or more of the same one), the chance of plant feeling not absolutely perfect are lower because we have more detailed view. Same principle apllies by going further.  
At the last circle there is a lot of options. The part of the fun is that the user has to find the best absolute combination for his/her plant. The right order of adding things will be displayed above the circle thing by showing steps. 
Amount of substances added can be determined for all of the different plants. For example, if the step by step says : soil-soil-soil-water. The user adds 100g of soil three times and 100ml of water one time.
I described how this example can be used on my project, but in the same way it can be useful in many different areas
